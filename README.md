<h1>Contact Form.</h1>

<p><strong>I want to credit the contact form to Sefyudem, https://github.com/sefyudem/Contact-Us-Form/blob/master/style.css</strong>

<li>I added the solar panel check list next to the text input for better user experience and information. 
Back ground image aswell is changed and i choose that background because of the ambiet orange light and white it displays.
Container-box right (solar checklist image) is set to display:none; when viewed on mobile devices and is only visible on 1200px and up.</li>

<li>Preview of the contact page on big display.</li>

<h1>User feedback/bugs found</h1>

<li>When opening from some IOS devices the panel header miss-aligns</li>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1VZ4SIu.png">

<li>On mobile device display ratio, the menu tab 'Home' is under contact form and not forming all 3 in row. This problem is only in Gallery and Contact Form pages</li>
<p>This seems to have been fixed by adding the block-size: fit-content rule to body for 950px and down, code line 460.</p>
<li>ONGOING issue: Seems there is a bug where opening developer tools makes the site aligs to much to the right but when viewed another time it perfectly fits. I have not found a fix for yet and i will continue trying to pin it down.</li>
