I want to credit the contact form to Sefyudem, https://github.com/sefyudem/Contact-Us-Form/blob/master/style.css

I added the solar panel check list next to the text input for better user experience and information. 
Back ground image aswell is changed and i choose that background because of the ambiet orange light and white it displays.
Container-box right (solar checklist image) is set to display:none; when viewed on mobile devices and is only visible on 1200px and up.
