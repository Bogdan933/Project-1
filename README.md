I made a normal 3 box flex container for the 3 typs of solar images since it was the method that worked best for me
The 3 images flex direction into colum at 765px X.

On big devices the 3 images display in a line.

<h1>Contact Form.</h1>

<p><strong>I want to credit the contact form to Sefyudem, https://github.com/sefyudem/Contact-Us-Form/blob/master/style.css</strong>

I added the solar panel check list next to the text input for better user experience and information. 
Back ground image aswell is changed and i choose that background because of the ambiet orange light and white it displays.
Container-box right (solar checklist image) is set to display:none; when viewed on mobile devices and is only visible on 1200px and up.

Preview of the contact page on big display.
