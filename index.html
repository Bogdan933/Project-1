                    Installation of systems that take advantage of solar energy (solar cells) is one of the most significant efforts that control our energy consumption to more renewable energy. 
                    The market for solar energy has come the farthest in development in terms of hardware components and software that together provide useful and efficient solutions. 

	                Government authorities offer investment support to promote the implementation of solar cell installations, 
                    both on a smaller scale for the home and on a larger scale.

                    How many hours of sunshine are needed to cover electricity production for a property depends on the electricity consumption, installation area and direction of the wind. 
                    Our objective is to design and dimension the facility so that the desired best possible output (kW) is achieved.

                    Solar cell installations have low variable costs, rarely require servicing and positively increase the value of the property. 
                    If you want to think big, there is an opportunity to become completely energy neutral. 
                    With good planning and the right conditions, it is entirely possible.

                    Solar energy is considered an improvement to your home and can increase the overall value of the house. 
                    The villa can thus become more attractive to potential buyers when and if you sell. Why? Reduced operating costs result in reduced variable costs and annual savings. 
                    Even the passive income from sold electricity and the possibility of financing the rest of the electricity bill have a value-enhancing effect when selling the villa.

	                Solar cells increase the property's standard regarding energy use. It is possible to carry out an energy inspection and energy certification, which gives you a certificate that the villa is energy efficient. 
                    If it is cheaper to move the villa around, 
                    more people can afford the property and then both the competition and probably the value of the house increases. 
                    In addition to financial aspects, solar cells are becoming more and more a symbol of environmental responsibility and concern for the future. 
                    Solar panels send a strong signal to the neighborhood and potential buyers.
